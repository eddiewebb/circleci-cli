# Circle CLI for Homebrew

This **unauthorized** CLI is based on the [official CLI from CircleCI](https://github.com/circleci/local-cli), but is a fixed version that generates a tarball for compliance to Homebrew Formula contribution rules.

To install (assuming this has been merged into homebrew) type `brew install circleci`
